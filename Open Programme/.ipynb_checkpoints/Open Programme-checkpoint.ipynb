    "# 1. What is Text Summarization in NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is the process of creating a short, coherent, and fluent summary of a longer text document and involves the outlining of the text’s major points. The image below represents how text summarization look like. That example is taken from a Google search of what text summarization is.\n",

    "# 2. Different approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches, which are used for text summarization. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Extractive Summarization - it is used to summarize articles by identifying the important sentences or phrases from the original text and stitch together portions of the content to produce a condensed version. These extracted sentences are then used to form the summary.\n",
    "   - Abstractive Summarization - relies on being able to paraphrase and shorten parts of a document using advanced natural language techniques. Since abstractive machine learning algorithms can generate new phrases and sentences to capture the meaning of the source document.\n",
