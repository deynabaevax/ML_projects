<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>
  Grammar checking tools have been around for some time. Many people such as students, teachers, content marketers and I have been using those. Thus, though they are pretty decent in correcting syntax and spelling errors, they are far from perfect. 
  Nevertheless, those tools are improving every day. Their developers are using ML, allowing them to find more errors and perfecting the user's writing skills.
