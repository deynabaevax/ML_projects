  Recently, I watched the old Italian film "La Dolce Vita (1960)" and during its screening I kept on thinking that it would have been prodigious if it was colored. So, this led me here to try and implement something similar. 
  
  To begin with, I will implement simple picture coloring and later on maybe I will try to do it with videos.
