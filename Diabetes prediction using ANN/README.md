# Introduction
Diabetes is one of the major diseases of the population across the world. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot efficiently use the insulin it produces. In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2012, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and high blood glucose was the cause of another 2.2 million deaths. Over the time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Early diagnosis can be made through a relatively inexpensive method of computation. 

# Goal
The purpose of this assignment is to make a predictive model using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and provide more insights into this matter.
