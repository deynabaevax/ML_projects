# Text Classification

# Introduction

This is a text classification project, which was created for the Open Programme, which is part of Semester 7 for the Advanced AI Specialization.

# Project Objective

The main goal of this Open Programme Challenge for me was to gain more knowledge, which I lacked. Besides that, my objective was to create a sentiment analysis model and, later, an application which visualizes the sentiment. Also, I decided to use PyTorch for a change and try out how it works. Moreover, I used transformers to enrich my knowledge and experience.
